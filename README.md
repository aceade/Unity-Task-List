# Unity-Task-List
A todo list for Unity projects.

**OVERVIEW**

I have a bit of a problem with keeping track of what needs doing in a project. So, here's a task list for your own projects. At the basic level is the Task class. This is quite simply a task which is either open/in progess or closed/finished, with a starting date and a description. A Category is a collection of tasks, which can be given a name such as Physics, AI or Player Interaction (to use examples from my own projects).

The other main component is the Editor panel. This also contains the methods to save and load categories (and their tasks) from the hard drive.


**HOW TO USE**

You can download this as a zip file, or clone it in Git. Either way, put it in the following folder inside your project:
Assets/Aceade/Todo List.


**LICENCE**

This is available under the MIT Licence.
